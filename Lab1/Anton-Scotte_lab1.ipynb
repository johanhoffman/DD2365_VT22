        "In this report, a solution method based on Finite Element discretizations of the weak form of the Stokes equations are implemented in the python package FEniCS. The Stokes equations are used to model viscous flow. Taylor-Hood elements as well as equal order elements for velocity and pressure are used for the simulation and adaptive mesh refinement has been implemented as well. The velocity and pressure solutions has been investigated with respect to stability and stability is verified for the Taylor-Hood elements where the Inf-Suf condition is valid. The Inf-sup condition is however, not fullfilled, with equal order elements as the results show. "

        "With the Taylor Hood elements the solution looks like expected for the velocity and for the pressure. With the equal order elements the solution looks as expected for the velocity but not for the pressure. This is due to the fact that the inf-sup condition is not fulfilled when the order is not sufficiently high for the velocity with respect to the order of the pressure. This gives rise to instabilities in the solution for the pressure which can clearly be seen as the pressure in this case has unphysical attributes. "
